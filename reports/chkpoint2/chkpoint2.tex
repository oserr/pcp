\section*{Summary}
We were unable to complete the lock-free list task as we had planned to do so by
this checkpoint; however, we are still on track to meet all of our deliverables.
Even though we did not implement the lock-free list, we invested time in
researching different implementation techniques, and this will be valuable this
upcoming week as we implement the lock-free list. We've also begun making
progress on the benchmark harness for the linked-lists, and decided to add a
linked list with fine-grained spinning-reader-writer locks to the mix of lists
we will use in our benchmarks.

\section*{Work Done}
We implemented a fine-grained doubly-linked list. We used the hand-over-hand
locking technique presented in the lecture 17 slides. The code in the slides
contains some unnecessary checks of {\tt curr}, but overall the same
hand-over-hand pattern can be used in any function that traverses the list. We
noticed that the overall structure of the algorithms could be used with
different kinds of locks, so we decided to implement a spinning-reader-writer
lock to create a fine-grained spinning-reader-writer lock doubly-linked list
which we will also use in our benchmarks. The full implementation of the
spinning-reading-write lock is included in Figure~\ref{fig:rwlock}.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\begin{lstlisting}
struct RwLock {
  std::atomic_int counter{0};

  void ReadLock() noexcept {
    int val, old;
    do {
      while ((val = counter.load()) < 0)
        ;
      old = val++;
    } while (not counter.compare_exchange_weak(old, val));
  }

  void ReadUnlock() noexcept { --counter; }

  void WriteLock() noexcept {
    int val, old;
    do {
      while ((val = counter.load()) != 0)
        ;
      old = val--;
    } while (not counter.compare_exchange_weak(old, val));
  }

  void WriteUnlock() noexcept { ++counter; }
};
\end{lstlisting}

\end{figure}

We also created more tests with GoogleTest. We converted the hashmap and list
unit tests to type-parametrized tests. This allows us to use the same set of
tests on any list or hashmap that supports the APIs we have defined. Instead of
creating different tests, we simply add one line with the type of list or
hashmap to be tested. These are serial tests that simply test that all the
functions work correctly on a single-threaded environment, but we also created a
type-parametrized multi-threaded concurrent list test that ensures lists work
correctly with multiple threads making insertions and removals simultaneously.

We began implementing the benchmark harness for the lists, which will allow us
to test a list with different parameters, including different number of threads,
total items to insert/remove from the list, and different use-profiles, e.g.,
80\% inserts, 10\% removes, and 10\% lookups vs 50\% inserts, 25\% removes, and
25\% lookups. What remains is to add logic to pass in all the parameters via the
command line, and perhaps to add additional logic for different kinds of tests,
e.g., preload list with items to be able to run a use-profile with 50\% removals
and 50\% lookups.

% Patricio: researched implementation techniques for lock-free list

We've also trimmed down or list of candidates for a C++ concurrent library down
to
\begin{itemize}
\item
\href{https://github.com/01org/tbb}{tbb} Intel's concurrent library, Threading
Building Blocks (TBB).
\item
\href{https://github.com/facebook/folly}{folly} Facebooks open-source library,
which includes concurrent data structures.
\end{itemize}
TBB seems ideal, but we are not yet commited to it because we don't know how easy
it will be to build it and use it. As of now, the only thing we can say is that it
builds on Linux with a simple {\tt make}, but the same command on macOS will make
it barf (at least on Omar's mac).

\section*{Goals}
We are not removing any of our goals, but are modifying some of them slightly.
Our deliverables are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
Implement a concurrent doubly-linked list with different kinds of locks:
coarse-grained locks, fine-grained locks, and fine-grained
spinning-reader-writer locks.
\item % Patricio: correcto?
Implement a concurrent lock-free singly-linked list.
\item
Compare the performance of the lists, including serial version, with respect to
number of threads and use-profile, e.g., 80\% inserts, 10\% removals, 10\%
lookups.
\item
Implement concurrent hashmaps with each one of our lists.
\item
Compare the performance of the hashmaps, including serial version, with respect
to the number of threads and different use-profiles.
\item
Compare performance of our library with another C++ library, e.g., TBB.
\item
{\bf Nice-to-have}. Parallelize algorithm/problem with our data structures.
\end{itemize}

We are confident that we can complete all our delivarables, but it seems highly
unlikely that we'll have a chance to apply our data structures to an algorithm
or problem; however, if we are able to make quick progress on our remaining
tasks, then we'll definitely look into it, but as of now we have not had any
time to look into this.


\section*{Schedule}
Table~\ref{table:sche} contains an updated version of the schedule. The week is
packed with tasks, but we should be able to move through some of these
relatively quickly. The benchmarking harness for the lists is almost complete,
and this will make it easier for us to write the harness for the hashmaps and
the data structures for the external library, because at the very least we
should be able to use the list benchmark harness as a template. It's hard to
gage how long it will take us to complete some of the other tasks, such as
implementing the lock-free list, or getting the library to work, but ultimately
we belive that 9 days are enough to get us to the end.

\section*{Pending Issues}
Our issues are for the most part resolved, and we have very good idea what
direction to take:

\begin{itemize}
\item
% Patricio: que tecnica vamos a usar?
Technique from paper.
\item
{\bf C++ concurrent library}. This is still in a somewhat fluid state, because
we've yet to benchmark a library, but we have at least two very good candidates
in {\tt tbb} and {\tt folly}. We'll start our experimentation with {\tt tbb} and
only move on to something else, or reach out for help, if we have trouble
getting the library to cooperate.
\item
{\bf Parallelizing algorithm/problem}. This is our {\it nice-to-have} item and
hence don't see it as something that needs to be resolved, because it doesn't
affect our deliverables. If we are able to complete our remaining tasks quickly
then we'll shift our focus to this, and reach out for help if necessary.
\end{itemize}

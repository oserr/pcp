\section*{Summary}
We are right on track with our original schedule, but are making some updates to
our schedule and our plans in response to the feedback we received on our
proposal, which includes:

\begin{itemize}
\item
Reframing our approach to the problem to be more purposeful.
\item
Substitute the Java concurrent package with a C/C++ multi-threading library.
\item
Change our {\it nice-to-have} for a problem or algorithm that can benefit from
our concurrent data structures.
\end{itemize}

All of these are in a fluid state because we've just received the feedback, but
these pivots shouldn't affect us negatively, because we are still working on
tasks that are not affected by them.

\section*{Work Done}
We setup our git repo and created a couple scripts to setup our work
environment: one to setup our git repo to use git-clang-format, and another one
to install a newer version of cmake on the GHC machines. We also created a basic
single-threaded doubly-linked list, a coarse-grained multi-threaded
doubly-linked list, and a hash map that can be configured with different linked
lists to be used as buckets. We also used GoogleTest to create unit tests for
the lists and the hash map. Figure~\ref{fig:dllist} shows the interface for our
lists.

\section*{Goals}
We are still planning to deliver the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Implement a concurrent doubly linked list using different
synchronization methods: course-grain locks, fine-grain locks and lock-free
techniques.
\item Compare the performance of each implementation of the doubly
linked list against each other and against the serial version with respect to
the number of threads.
\item Use the doubly linked list as a dequeue for each implementation and compare
their performance against the Java ConcurrentLinkedDeque data structure.
\item Implement a concurrent HashMap using different synchronization methods:
course-grain locks, fine-grain locks and lock-free techniques.
\item Compare the performance of each implementation of the HashMap against
each other and against the serial version with respect to the number of threads.
\item Compare the performance of each implementation of the HashMap against
the Java ConcurrentHashMap data structure.
\end{itemize}

Instead of trying another data structure as a {\it nice-to-have}, we are now
looking forward to the opportunity of applying our concurrent data structures to
an algorithm or problem. We don't have concrete ideas right now, but have
floated the idea of doing something like a search or graph algorithm, like
$A^*$, for example.

\section*{Schedule}
Table~\ref{table:sche} contains an updated version of the schedule. The new
schedule is the same as the original, minus completed tasks, and three
modifications:

\begin{itemize}
\item
Remove Java-related tasks, since we won't be using Java's concurrent package.
\item
Add a task for this week to find a C/C++ multi-threading library to use for
benchmarking.
\item
Change {\it nice-to-have} to one where we apply our concurrent data structures
to an algorithm or a problem.
\end{itemize}

The table contains a column to indicate how tasks are assigned. We are currently
right on track with our original schedule.
